    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/thibpat">Thibaut</a> and I'm working on this project on my spare time. I feel like I have to do something to help fight climate change, so I'm trying to use my skills to do my part.</p>
    <p>My personal mission is to <b>Accelerate the transition to a world without waste</b> and hopefully this project will help some consumers to switch to buying goods without packaging.</p>
